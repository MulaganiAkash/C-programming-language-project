OBJECTIVE:
-------
This project involves developing a basic ATM machine simulation using C programming. The ATM system allows a user to perform various banking operations such as withdrawing money, depositing money, checking balance, and exiting the system. The system is designed to work with a specific user named "AKASH" and includes security measures like PIN verification.

FEATURES & FUNCTIONALITIES:
====

1.WELCOME and CARD INSERTION:
--

 --->The user is prompted to insert their card by entering their name.

 --->The system recognizes the card only if the name "AKASH" is entered.

2.INITIAL SETUP:
--
--->The initial balance is set to 5000, and the PIN is fixed at 2580 for user authentication.

3.MAIN MENU OPTIONS:
--
--->The user is presented with four options:

                -Withdraw Money

                -Deposit Money 

                -Check Balance

                -Exit
4.WITHDRAW MONEY:
--
-->The user is prompted to enter a 4-digit PIN for verification.

--->Upon successful PIN entry, the user can enter the amount to withdraw.

-->The system checks if the balance is sufficient and updates the balance accordingly.

5.DEPOSIT MONEY:
--
-->The user is prompted to enter a 4-digit PIN for verification.

--->Upon successful PIN entry, the user can enter the amount to deposit.

--->The system updates the balance after the deposit.

6.CHECK BALANCE:
--
--->The user is prompted to enter a 4-digit PIN for verification.

--->Upon successful PIN entry, the system displays the current balance.

7.EXIT:
--
--->The user can choose to exit the system at any time.

SECURITY MEASURES:
===

--->The system uses a 4-digit PIN (2580) to authenticate the user before performing any 
transactions.

--->Incorrect PIN entries result in a message indicating the error and the user is returned to the main menu.

EXAMPLE USAGE:
===

--->User enters the card name "AKASH".

--->User selects an option from the main menu.

--->User enters the PIN (2580) for verification.

--->User performs the selected banking operation (withdraw, deposit, or check balance).

--->The system updates and displays the balance after the transaction.

CONCLUSION:
==

The ATM Machine Project successfully demonstrates the implementation of a basic banking system using C programming. It provides users with essential functionalities such as withdrawing money, depositing money, checking their balance, and securely exiting the system. By simulating an ATM interface, this project emphasizes the importance of user authentication through PIN verification and ensures secure transactions.

The project highlights key programming concepts, including string manipulation, conditional statements, and input/output operations, while also managing user balances effectively. Despite its simplicity, the system can be expanded with additional features, such as multiple user support and enhanced security measures, providing a solid foundation for more complex banking applications.

Overall, this project serves as a practical example of how to create an interactive and secure ATM machine simulation, showcasing the potential of C programming in real-world applications.
